# Introduction
This Repo will contain the code for a yet-to-make application for the [Accountability Hack 2016](https://accountabilityhack.nl/).
The application will use Angular 1.5 and is based on the [Angular NG6-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter)

Below you can find the bare instruction to get up running with this repo. More elaborate instructions can be found in de [Readme of NG6-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter/blob/master/README.md).

## Installing
* `clone` this repo
* `npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli webpack` install global cli dependencies
* `npm install` to install dependencies

## Running the App
NG6 uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `gulp` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.

### Generating Components
Following a consistent directory structure between components offers us the certainty of predictability. We can take advantage of this certainty by creating a gulp task to automate the "instantiation" of our components. The component boilerplate task generates this:
```
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName/
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.js // entry file where all its dependencies load
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.component.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.controller.js
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.html
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.styl // scoped to affect only its own template
⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅componentName.spec.js // contains passing demonstration tests
```

You may, of course, create these files manually, every time a new module is needed, but that gets quickly tedious.
To generate a component, run `gulp component --name componentName`.

The parameter following the `--name` flag is the name of the component to be created. Ensure that it is unique or it will overwrite the preexisting identically-named component.

The component will be created, by default, inside `client/app/components`. To change this, apply the `--parent` flag, followed by a path relative to `client/app/components/`.

For example, running `gulp component --name signup --parent auth` will create a `signup` component at `client/app/components/auth/signup`.  

Running `gulp component --name footer --parent ../common` creates a `footer` component at `client/app/common/footer`.  

Because the argument to `--name` applies to the folder name **and** the actual component name, make sure to camelcase the component names.
